# Remember to change IP_ADDRESS_GOES_HERE for `ansible_ssh_host` in the example below.

# When you run this exercise the very first time, keep this line below

ansibleexample  ansible_ssh_host=IP_ADDRESS_GOES_HERE     ansible_ssh_user=root          ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa    ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3


# but note that the first run of this exercise disables the root user on the target.
# Therefore, for the subsequent runs of ansible, please make sure to:
# Comment the line above and uncomment this line, and then use it in subsequent ansible runs
